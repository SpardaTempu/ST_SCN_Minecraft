Brewer: Brasseri (from the French brasseur), Birreri (another possibility)
Butterflyfish: Pisci Parpagghiuni
Clipboard: Ciappafogghiu (From ciappa: hook + fogghiu: paper, a fun shortening would be Ciappogghiu or Ciappagghiu)

Teleport: Telecarriari (tele- from a distance, carriari to transport, similarly to the English origin), Telespurtu (same concept as in English, tele- (trans)port, so tele- (tra)spurtari), alternatively could be Telepurtu, which would ironically result in a full Sicilianization of teleport), Teletraspurtu (if a more full transposition from Italian is desired)
Tick: Ticchi (Tick in the sense of game-time sounds a lot like the tick tock of clocks, so ticchi tocchi should be a familiar enough translation)
Timeout: Foratempu (Fora 'out' + Tempu 'time')
